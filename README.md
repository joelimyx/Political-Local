## Major issues and future implementation
- Improve the UI and UX of the app
- Juggling between two different API to get the most up to date info in congress and versatile search function.
- Shifting thru the mountain of data
- Allow users to save their favorite bills and candidates on the cloud.
- Smarter search function - ability to know the entity of the search term
- News section will be hard to scale in the future as it is depends on Bing News Search API.
- Senators and Representatives votes on bills.
- Tablet and landscape friendly
